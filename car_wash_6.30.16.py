# Emulate a car wash by asking user for type of car and type of wash. Give user the options for both.
# Set your prices depending on type of wash and type of car.
# Output should be a print statement that will tell the user what type of wash and car along with the price of the wash (including tax)
# ie format should be something like : â€œ You have chosen (type of wash) for (type of car), your total will be (price)
